# Elevator
Elevator program which takes asyn input of direction and floor and simulates the elevator operation.
This is a C# console application which simulates an elevator that asynchronously accepts inputs in the form of button presses that call the elevator to a floor in a given direction.
As you run the console application it should prompt with the following console message --> Please enter direction up or down (u/d) followed by floor number to go (1 - 10). E.g. u9 or d3.
When you see this you can type u1-u10 to go up the floor 1 to 10 and d1-d10 to go down the floor 10 to 1. Elevator should prompt you as you reach the floor and wait for 5 seconds(a sample wait). Console should be available to take as many inputs as needed as fast as you can type, the elevator will take you to each floor in order with a wait time of 5 seconds in each floor. Enjoy the elevator!
